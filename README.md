# HateSpeechDetection
Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis Project focusing on Hate Speech Detection. 

The work is divided in three parts; the first focuses on classification using traditional algorithms using TfIf and Word Embeddings, while the second focuses on classification using Neural Networks with word Embeddings. Both parts are implemented for both binary and multiclass classification.
The third part focuses on keywords and key phrases extraction in english and french with WordClouds (for english only), KeyBert and BerTopic (for both languages).
The project was implemented in Google Colab and all notebooks are provided with a badge to directly open the notebooks in the Colab environment; all datasets to use are indicated in the code and are provided in the Data Folder. 
For BerTopic, Graphic Output is available when opening the notebook in Google Colab. 
Additionaly, notebooks with no output are provided.

As a last note, I acknowledge notebooks have been split - thus the repetition of some of the code - due to the limitations in resources provided by Colab, and all classification sections could potentially be integrated and run together.
